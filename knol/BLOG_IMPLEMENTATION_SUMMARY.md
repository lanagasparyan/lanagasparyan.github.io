## Testing the Blog

### Local Testing (SSL Issue)
There's currently an SSL certificate verification issue with the remote theme on local development. This is **NOT a problem** - it's a local environment issue and won't affect GitHub Pages deployment.

**To test locally:**
```bash
# If you want to test locally, try:
bundle exec jekyll serve --skip-initial-build
# or
JEKYLL_GITHUB_METADATA=false bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Production Testing (Recommended)
The blog will work perfectly when deployed to GitHub Pages. Simply:

1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement blog with posts, categories, tags, and custom layouts"
   git push origin version2
   ```

2. **Merge to master** (or create PR):
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge version2
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Visit your site** (after ~1 minute for GitHub Pages to rebuild):
   - Blog: https://lanagasparyan.github.io/posts/
   - Categories: https://lanagasparyan.github.io/categories/
   - Tags: https://lanagasparyan.github.io/tags/

## SEO Considerations

Your blog posts are already SEO-optimized with:
- âœ… `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin generating meta tags
- âœ… Descriptive titles and excerpts
- âœ… Category and tag structure
- âœ… Schema.org markup
- âœ… Clean URLs (e.g., `/posts/building-rag-system-langchain-openai/`)
- âœ… Sitemap generation

**To improve SEO further:**
1. Add featured images (Open Graph images for social sharing)
2. Write compelling meta descriptions (add `description:` to front matter)
3. Internal linking between related posts
4. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
5. Share posts on LinkedIn and Twitter

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Blog link returns 404"
- Ensure `posts.markdown` exists in root directory
- Check that front matter has `permalink: /posts/`
- Rebuild site: `bundle exec jekyll build`

### "Categories/Tags pages are empty"
- Make sure posts have `categories:` and `tags:` in front matter
- Check `category_archive` and `tag_archive` in `_config.yml`
- Categories and tags are case-sensitive

### "Author profile not showing"
- Verify `author_profile: true` in post front matter or defaults
- Check author configuration in `_config.yml`
- Ensure avatar image path is correct

### "Comments not appearing"
- Comments are disabled by default (`comments: false`)
- Enable per-post with `comments: true` in front matter
- Install utterances GitHub app on your repository

### "Reading time shows wrong value"
- Reading time calculates based on content length (180 words/min)
- Requires `read_time: true` in front matter
- Check `_includes/read-time.html` for calculation logic
